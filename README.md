EDUCATIONAL APPLICATION, NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE

An application made to assist a pediatric hospital in paperless operation. Faculty members can perform their daily tasks,
store data about the patients, and contact the patients when necessary.
Patients can view their previous visits, prescriptions, and contact the faculty members.

To use, log in with any of the accounts below, additionally you can create a new account for further testing.
Testing Accounts:
  - Patinet Admin: Username - admin_patient2024, Password - password123
  - Nurse Admin: Username - admin_nurse2024, Password - password123
  - Doctor Admin: Username - admin_doctor2024, Password - password123

All data is secured through AES encryption with a single key.

Data is stored directly on the user's hard drive for simplicity but is easily modified to use a database.

Controller classes and operations are easily reusable if/when the project would need to move to a web-based 
or mobile-based system. User Interfaces would need to be remade for the particular platform being used.
